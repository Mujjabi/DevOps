===============================================
Visualization Report  Assignment Description
----------------------------------------------


Every week, you are to turn in a visualization you have found in the media (newspapers, magazines, online journalism) and a brief summary of something you like/don't like, think is interesting, etc.

These are meant to be easy points: No more than 2-3 sentences are needed in your description.

Each week, one of you will at random be asked to describe the visualization you picked to the class.
