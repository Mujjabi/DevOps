The visualization below was published by Pacific Standard newspaper and reported by **Stanford Kay on July 14, 2017**. The visualization presents an international comparison of total and per-capital carbon emissions to identify countries with the highest emissions. Identifying the primary carbon emitters would enable the international community to set regulations that would help to reduce their carbon footprint, hence reducing the impacts of climate change globally.

I liked that this data was presented in the form of a footprint, which directly correlated to the message (carbon footprint) that is portrayed by the writer. I liked how each country was presented as a circle, and the size of the circle was proportional to the amount of carbon emitted in that partial country. Secondly, it was also interesting to see that countries with the strongest economies, such as the US, China, India, Japan and European countries, have the highest emissions compared to developing countries such as my home country, Uganda. However, it was interesting to see that some of the developing countries/territories, such as the Virgin Islands, had the highest emissions per capita compared to the developed countries with the highest total carbon emissions. 

I think that comparing these two datasets using similar graphic representations is misleading to the reader. For example, the circle shows that the per-capita emissions in the Virgin Islands and  Gibraltar are bigger than the total emissions of big countries such as the USA and China. The foot on the right side (per capita) is a function of the country's population, hence, countries with low population size will seem to have high emissions per capita and vice versa. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that these countries have higher emissions than the countries with huge total emissions.
