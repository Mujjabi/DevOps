The visualization below was published on September 27, 2022, by Nick Routley on the visual capitalist [website](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/). The visualization was constructed using the 2022 population data reported by the UN population division. 
Since the world population reached 8 billion people in 2022, the visualization shows the distribution of this population by continent and country. 

First and foremost, I liked using a circle/globe to symbolize the planet Earth and different colors to represent each region/continent on planet Earth. The circle was further partitioned into polygons to represent countries, with sizes equivalent to their respective population sizes, regardless of their total geographical area.  It is very easy to differentiate between countries based on their color and compare population sizes based on the polygons assigned to each country. 

One thing I didn't like about the visualization is that, in some cases, countries with lower population sizes were condensed into one polygon and labeled as "Rest of ...". A good visualization should be able to represent all countries equally. Also, it would be interesting to combine the population size and geographical area in one visualization to identify regions with high/low population density.
