The visualization below was published on September 27, 2022 by Nick Routley on the visual capitalist [website](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/). The visualization was constructed using the 2022 population data reported by the UN population division. 
Since the world population reached 8 billion people in 2022, the visualization shows the distribution of this population by continent and country. 

First and foremost, I liked the use of a circle/globe to symbolize the planet earth and the use of different colors to represent each region/continent on planet earth. The circle was further partitioned into polygons to represent countries, with sizes equivalent to their respective population sizes, regardless of their total geographical area.  It is very easy to differentiate between countries based on the color assigned to them, and compare population sizes basing on the polygons assigned to each country. 

One thing i didnt like about the visualization is that is some cases, countries with lower population sizes were condensed into one polygon and labeled as "Rest of ...". I think a good visualization should be able represent all contries equally. Also, it would be interesting to combine both the population size and geographical area in one visualization to indentify regions with high/low population density.
