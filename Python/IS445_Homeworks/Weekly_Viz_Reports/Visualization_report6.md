The visualization shows the history of global energy use and transitions, published by Govind Bhutada on April 8, 2022 on the visualcapitalist [website](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-the-history-of-energy-transitions/) and obtained on September 28th, 2023. 

The visualization shows the timelime of the global energy production and consumption and how how energy use transitioned from the traditional use of raw biomass in the 1800s to the current use of renawable energy sources. 

I liked the used of different colors to distinguise between energy sources and how how this transitions ranges from brown/black (Biomas and coal) symbolizing environmentally unfriendly sources to green (nuclear and renewable) to represent more sustainable and environmentally friendly sources. 

What was unclear to me was that I didnt understand whether this visualization was a stacked-graph showing the cumulative sum of energy sub-divided into the different forms of energy consumed. Forexample, in the Year 2000, was the renewable energy consumption 20K TWh ( 160k - 140K), or was it a total of 160K TWh?. I also expected the amount of non-renewable energy sources to be reducing with time due to the emergence of renewable sources, but based on the visualization, all energy sources follow an increasing trend, which im not sure if the data shows the similar trend or the visualization is misrepresenting the data.
