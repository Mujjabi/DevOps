The Visualization titled **"Where Does Our Food Come From"** was obtained from the visual capitalist [website](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/where-does-our-food-come-from/) and was reported by Tessa Di Grandi on November 22, 2022. The Visualization is a world map showing the historical origin (source of origin) of major agricultural crops before there eventually domesticaded globally. The visualization was constructed using data from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)

This visualization empasizes that massive production of a given crop in a certain region doesnt neccesary indicate that the said region is the source of origin of the crop. Over two-thirds of the world's major crops originated in regions different from where they are primarily cultivated today. Due to human cultivation and selective breeding for over thousands of years, numerous crops have been cultivated in various regions, often far from their original places of origin and domestication. For example, The U.S. is the major producer of maize globally, yet the crop (*Zea mays*) was originally domesticated in Mexico. 

This is so far my favorite visualization not only because I am a crop science major, but also because of the way the the data was presented. They used plant icons to symbolize particular crops, which made the visualization easy to read. They also used different colors to distuinguish between regions of origin such as West Africa, southern Africa, North America, Northern Europe etc. Even though specific countries of origin are not pinpointed, the reader gets a general idea of where certain crops originated. Some of the fruits/crop icons were small and difficult to read, but a legend was provided to solve this issue.
