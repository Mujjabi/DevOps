Thee visualization below titled **"Country Risk Map in 2023"** was publisehd by Dorothy Neufeld on October 9, 2023 on the visual capitalist [website](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/investment-risk-by-country-map/). 

The visualization uses financial analysis data reported by Aswath Damodaran from New York University's Stern School of Business to assess the risk involved in making financial invenstiments in different countries around the world as of 2023. The risk assessment (country risk premium) is conducted using specific determinants or factors such as political, legal and economic stability of a given country, using the U.S as a reference/standard.

According to the visualization, the highest-risk countries, including Belarus, Lebanon, Venezuela and Sudan, which face significant challenges such as conflicts, hyperinflation, and corruption. In contrast, the lowest-risk countries, including several European nations, Singapore, and New Zealand due to their high benefit from AAA-rated government bonds, low corruption, and strong property rights protections. 

I liked the use of a color gradient to represent the risk level across all countries, where the thicker the color, the riskier the country. However, sometimes its difficult to differentiate risk levels if specific risk values were not provided in the map. 
I also didnt not like the maginification of the European countries, which doesnt preserve the scaling and size of the map. This shows a level of bias in data delivery since it gives focus to particular countries than others. I also didnt understand why certain countries where rated as 0% risk, since I think there is no such thing as no rsik in business/investiment. However, I am an agronomist and not an international financial analyst.
