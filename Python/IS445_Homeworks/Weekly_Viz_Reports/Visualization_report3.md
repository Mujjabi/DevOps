The visualization below was published on the Nebraska Medicine [website](https://www.nebraskamed.com/COVID/what-covid-19-variants-are-going-around) on September 7, 2023, showing the current most dominant Covid-19 variants in the United States, following the recent resurgence of the covid infections. The stacked-bar chart shows that the two most dominant COVID-19 variants in the United States are EG.5 and FL.1.5.1, accounting for over 21.5% and 14.5% of the reported COVID-19 cases nationwide, respectively. The variants are determined through genomic sequencing of the virus to identify mutations at specific regions of the virus RNA.

I like the visualization because it condenses huge datasets of weekly COVID-19 infections and the respective variants responsible for these infections in a single chart. We can also clearly see the transition between dominant variants with time, hence tracking their impact and issuing recommendations for managing them. 
I did not like the color coding in the visualization, particularly in the legend, since it is very difficult to distinguish between some variants presented using almost similar colors. For example, there are six shades of green, over four shades of blue, and three shades of orange and pink. This could be presented differently to make it easier to differentiate between variants.
