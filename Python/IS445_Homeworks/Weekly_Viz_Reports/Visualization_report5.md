The visualization shows the history of pandemics by Nicholas LePan, published on the visualcapitalist [website](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/) on March 14, 2020 and obtained from on September 26, 2023. 

The visualization shows the timeline of the most deadliest pendemics in the history of humankind starting all way back from the Antonine plague in the 165 to Covid-19 in 2020. I Like this visualization because it is very informative, and well labeled. We can see the year when the pendemic brokeout, the name of the plague and the number of of people it claimed (death toll). The use of colors to differentiate between different pendemics was also helpful to read the visualization easily. I also like how they used the symbol of a pathogen/virus to represent the pendemic. 

The issue I had with this visualization was the scaling of the axis, particulary the years and the zise of the viruses. Even though it was intentional to use a 3D compressed timeline graph to present the historical occurence of the pendemics, the difference in sizes makes the recent pendemics more emphazised than the far past pendemics. For example, the size of the virus in the visualization is a function of the death toll of that particular virus. However, based on the 3D timeline, HIV and Spanish flu appear to be way bigger than the Bubonic plague, even though they only claimed 4 to 6 times less lives than the bubonic plaque. 

Also, some of the pendemics had very huge death toll margins where the exact number of lives claimed is unknown. For example, 30-50M for the plague of Justinian, 40-50M for spanish flu, 25-35M for HIV. With these huge margins, its erronous to use the "size of the virus" to compare death tolls.
