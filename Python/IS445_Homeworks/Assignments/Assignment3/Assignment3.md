===============================================
Assignment 3
-----------------------
Student: Christopher Mujjabi

**Date: October 16, 2023**

## Instructions

Your assignment for this week is to build a web page on GitHub pages (which can be with a "burner account", as long as you supply that info to us) that includes a vega-lite visualization of the building inventory dataset.

This will have three steps:

1. Develop a visualization using vega-lite using the building inventory data
2. Deploy this visualization in JSON format to your GitHub pages
3. Write the initialization javascript code to create the visualization in your page

You will have three weeks, as we have not covered quite enough yet to make the final step work.

What to submit: A PDF file containing (1) a link to your GitHub repository and (2) a link to the page showing the visualization.

## Links
1. link to github repository: 


2. Link to the page showing the visualization:
