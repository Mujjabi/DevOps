### Data formats
1. ASCII

2. JSON
- row oriented. 
multiple types (string, number, object, array, boolean, null)

  - Ordinal Data : Data u can put in order on a scale

   - Discrete : Coutable eg number of dogs
   - Continous data: Measurable and takes a continuous set of values (volume, length, densit)


## Drawing
Images are drawn pixel by pixel
1. Raster representation
- each pixel is represented as a color
-  common formats are gif,jpg,png
- compresseion is lossy

2. Vector  representation

- this can include paths , patterns, shapes and text
- common file formats are svg,pdf and eps
- display doesnt exit until it is rendered


## Data Manipulation
 1. Filtering Operations

 2. Mutation 
 - Mathematical operations 
 - smoothing
3. Splitting operations

## Group discussion
