### Instructions
1. Identify three visualizations in pop culture -- not academic literature. This could be, for instance, from:
     - Movies / TV / Music videos
     - Everyday life
     - Advertisements
2. Describe each one in detail
     - Where did the data come from?
     - Is the data quantitative, qualitative, categorical, etc?
     - How was the data processed before being displayed?
     - What method was used to display that data?
3. Replicate the visualization with different, but similarly "shaped," data
     - By hand is acceptable
     - Computational methods should include source code
