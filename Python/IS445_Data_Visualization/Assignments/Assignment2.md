IS 445 - ACG/ACU: Data Visualization - Fall 2023
===============================================
Assignment 2
-----------------------
Student: Christopher Mujjabi

### Using one of the tools that we have discussed (matplotlib now or vega-lite soon), construct a visualization of the Illinois Building Inventory that communicates the following information:

- Relationship between the year acquired and the year constructed
- Total square footage as a function of congressional district
- Average square footage per floor as a function of congressional district
- Square footage for the five most common departments as a function of year

Each component will be worth 5 points and must be a completely communicative visualization -- including labels and a one paragraph writeup of successes and shortcomings in your approach. Submit a notebook or a set of JSON gists to Moodle. All source code must be in these files.

You will have three weeks to complete this assignment. You do not yet have enough in your toolbox to do this
