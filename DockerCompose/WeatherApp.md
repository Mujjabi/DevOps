# Data Base
Redis db
- collecting cache from user - in-session caching. When user behavior is stored to enhance user convenience. Like when you google something, next time, Google will give you suggestions based on your history of searches.
- When I watch the Premier League, YouTube will suggest other Premier League matches without searching them.
