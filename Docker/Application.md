## Types of Applications
As devop engineers, we deal with 2 types of applications: 
1. Stateless application:

Is an application program that does not save client data generated in one session for use in the next session with the client.

Each session is carried out as if it was the first time and responses are not dependent upon data from a previous session. 

This means this application doesnt require **"volume"** and no **database.**

2. Stateful application. 

Stateful applications save data to persistent disk storage for use by the server, bu client and by the other applications.

An example of a stateful application is a databse or key-value store to which data is saved and retrieved by other applications. 

Therefore, **You need to persist a volume. You need a database.**
