## Components of K8
We have 2 components:
   - The master / control plae
   - The cluster / Node group
The master controls the cluster.

### Terminologies 
You can have K8 on premise, or you can have it online. When it is on-premise, the components are called master and cluster. However, when you have it virtually, it is called the control plane, and node group. 
On-premise  = Physically present. 
Cloud  = Virtual / online
