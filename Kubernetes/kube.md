### Terminologies 
You can have K8 on premise, or you can have it online. When it is on-premise, the components are called master and cluster. However, when you have it virtually, it is called the control plane, and node group. 
On-premise  = Physically present. 
Cloud  = Virtual / online

### Administer K8.
If your K8 is on premise, it means you are responsible for physically buying and installing the k8 infrastructure. If anything happens, you are responsible for fixing it and you control everything. This is called administering k8. 

If someone asks you "do you administer k8? and you say yes, it means you have just told them your k8 is on-premise.
